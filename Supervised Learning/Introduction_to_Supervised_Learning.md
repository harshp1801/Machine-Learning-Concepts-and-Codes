## Supervised Machine Learning

---

- **Definition:**
    - Supervised Learning is the Machine Learning algorithm which used to work with labeled Data.
    - The objective of supervised machine learning algorithm is to learn the relationship between the input and output variables and based on these learning make prediciton about the unseen/new data.

    - Supervised Machine Learning is further classified as:

        - **Regression:**
            - Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to make predictions about the continuous variables based on one or more independent features.
            - Regression techniques are further classified as:
                - **Simple Linear Regression:** 
                    - Simple Linear Regression technique is used when one independent and one dependent feature is involved, It is one of the simplest statistical model used it assumes that their exist linear relationship betwween input and output feature. That is the change in the independent feature is directly proportional to dependent feature.
                - **Multiple Linear Regression:** 
                    - Multiple Linear Regression technique is an extension of simple linear regression where two or more (multiple) independent are involved.
                - **Polynomial regression:** 
                    - Polynomial regression is used to model non-linear relationship between independent and dependent feature by introducing a polynomial term to capture the non linearity.
